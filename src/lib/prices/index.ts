 * stocks, Yahoo goes first (primary — see yahoo-provider.ts for why Twelve
 * Data can't hold that role), then TradingView and Twelve Data as
 * exchange-suffix-shaped fallbacks: TradingView.supports() only matches
 * dotted (mostly European) symbols, TwelveData.supports() only matches
 * non-dotted (US-shaped) ones, so the two never compete for the same asset —
 * order between them doesn't matter for correctness, only for reading order.
